## Game Summary Pitch

You are an alchemist making potions for your local community. They have problems, problems only alchemy is fit to solve. Like impotence. And a cheating spouse. And... you know... stuff.

Oh yeah, there's an eldritch horror in your closet that needs to be fed. Or the world will end.

The monsters are hot?
